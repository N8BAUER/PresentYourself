# PresentYourself
My project attempts to solve the problem of preparing for a presentation.
The problem lies in the fact that when preparing for a presentation you don't always have access to an audience or an audience that isn't even comparable to your target group.  Thus you have to spend time traveling to an audience and recruit people to participate in your rehearsal; which costs almighty time. In addition to that, this experience typically provides questionable feedback from friends or co-workers that may not want to spurn you by being blunt. You also, end up revealing your presentation to the people probably watching your rehearsal. Lastly, your audience sized is more than likely dwarf in comparison to what reality might present.

# What is it?
It's a streaming service to rehearse your upcoming presentations to a live audience consisting of random Users from PresentYourself.tv

# Future implementations:

..*A shareable URL to stream privately to only the users you selected.
..*A friends list
..*Private messagini
